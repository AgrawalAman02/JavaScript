## app_guessGame

This is a basic guess random number game based only on JavaScript. Here's how it works:

- The system will guess a number within a range that you provide.
- You also specify the number of turns you want to guess.
- In each turn, if you guess wrong, you'll get a hint about the range and how many turns you have left.
- After successfully guessing, you'll see how many turns you took in the console window.

## Future Updates

Stay tuned for a better version including HTML, CSS, and backend enhancements!
